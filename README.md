# News-Sentiment-Analysis
News Classification Project
Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering
Project Overview:
This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The project focuses on Sentiment analysis of news, where we apply various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Language Models to identify the sentiment of news articles into predefined categories. This project involves exploring techniques like text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluating the models for their effectiveness in identifying the news sentiment.

Project Title:
Sentiment analysis in news using Natural Language Processing

Project Abstract:
The Sentiment analysis model processes the content of newsprint, which categorizes them as either positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It reads large volumes of text to detect the emotional impact that news has on its readers and society. The framework consists of text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal and lemmatization), aggregation of sentiment through several classifiers and data collection from across multiple sources. The goal of this project is to improve information consumption, improve decision-making, and enrich our understanding of news sentiment during the digital age.

Algorithms Used:
Machine Learning Algorithms:
Logistic Regression
XGBoost
Catboost 

Deep Learning Algorithms:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
BiDirectional Long Short-Term Memory(BiLSTM)
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
CNN and LSTM

Language Models:
RoBERTa
DistilBERT 
Comparative Analysis:
The comparative analysis of different models highlights their effectiveness in classifying news articles into the correct category. The following table summarizes the accuracy of the models tested:

MODELS                                       ACCURACY
CatBoost + FastText                           0.7443
XGBoost + BoW                                 0.8129
Logistic Regression + Combined Features       0.8000
CNN + Word2Vec                                0.5536
LSTM + Word2Vec                               0.4521
CNN-BiLSTM + Word2Vec                         0.5333
BiLSTM + Word2Vec                             0.4405
DistilBERT                                    0.7777
RoBERTa                                       0.6620


Conclusion:
This News sentiment analysis project demonstrates the potential of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Language Models for text classification tasks, particularly for identifying news sentiment. The comparative analysis reveals that XGBoost, a machine learning-based model, outperforms transformer methods and deep learning models in terms of accuracy. By employing various algorithms, we gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, allowing us to choose the most suitable approach for news classification.
